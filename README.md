### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master student in economics at CEMFI in Madrid. I am interested in doing research in economics particularly in Industrial Organization, Urban and applied Microeconometrics. In the summer of 2020 I was a research intern at the Bank of Spain (Banco de Espana). You can find a repo containing a description of my work and all the code I wrote [here](https://github.com/Ihegde97/stata_code/blob/master/README.md). 

Some R code from my microeconometrics course at CEMFI can be found [here](https://github.com/Ihegde97/Rcode).

Similarly, I have a sample empirical project [here](https://github.com/Ihegde97/empirical_structure) that sheds light on my general workflow regarding directory structure and documentation for a representative empirical project.


Before CEMFI I was an undegraduate student at the City University of Hong Kong where I majored in economics and minored in mathematics. During this time I also interned at [IFMR LEAD](https://ifmrlead.org/) which also houses J-PAL South Asia. During this time I worked with [Dr. Nikkil Sudharsannan](https://sites.google.com/view/nikkilsud)

Recently I have been interested in Machine Learning, especially their applications to economics. To this end I participated in the opensource Machine learning course [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/roadmap). I also completed the two part Python programming course from the University of Toronto [Python Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program) and [Crafting Quality Code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/program-code).
