### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master student in economics at CEMFI in Madrid. I am interested in doing research in economics particularly in development, urban and applied microeconometrics. In the summer of 2020 I was a research intern at the Bank of Spain (Banco de Espana). You can find a repo containing a description of my work and all the code I wrote [here](https://github.com/Ihegde97/stata_code/blob/master/README.md). 


Before CEMFI I was an undegraduate student at the City University of Hong Kong where I majored in economics and minored in mathematics. During this time I also interned at [IFMR LEAD](https://ifmrlead.org/) which also houses J-PAL South Asia. During this time I worked with [Dr. Nikkil Sudharsannan](https://sites.google.com/view/nikkilsud)

Recently I have been interested in Machine Learning, especially their applications to economics. To this end I participated in the opensource Machine learning course [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/roadmap). My assignments for the course were completed in Python. They are available in the form of Kaggle Notebooks [here](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks?sortBy=dateRun&group=profile&pageSize=20). Do note they are currently not formatted and might be rough around the edges. I also completed the two part Python programming course from the University of Toronto [Python Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program) and [Crafting Quality Code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/program-code). Unfortunately obtaining certificates of completion is expensive so I do not have them. I could forward a screenshot or an email from Coursera if needed.

I am currently looking for a Pre-Doctoral research position starting in the summer of 2021.
