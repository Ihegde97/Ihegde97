### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master student in economics at CEMFI in Madrid. I am interested in doing research in economics particularly in development, urban and applied microeconometrics. In the summer of 2020 I was a research intern at the Bank of Spain (Banco de Espana). You can find a repo containing a description of my work and all the code I wrote [here](https://github.com/Ihegde97/stata_code/blob/master/README.md). 

Before CEMFI I was an undegraduate student at the City University of Hong Kong where I majored in economics and minored in mathematics. During this time I also interned at [IFMR LEAD](https://ifmrlead.org/) which also houses J-PAL South Asia. During this time I worked with [Dr. Nikkil Sudharsannan](https://sites.google.com/view/nikkilsud)

I am currently looking for a Pre-Doctoral research position starting in the summer of 2021.
